# Team5_AI_Project

Team 5 final project on the use of AI in Human Resource activities. 

**Authors:** HAS TO BE LINKED TO OUR ACTUAL GITHUB and readme profile description

**Project Scope** 

- To design and develop an AI-based system that assists human resources (HR) departments in screening resumes efficiently. 

The system will include:

1. A resume scanning tool integrated into a web-based application for companies to use in their hiring process.
2. A deep learning model to classify whether a candidate's resume is qualified for a specific job role or not based on predefined criteria (e.g., skills, experience, education).
3. The integration of AI to streamline the candidate selection process and reduce human bias.

**Project Details** 

*Project Statement:* 
In this case project, we are trying to better understand/provide insight into how AI plays a roll in human resources management. Specifically, we are looking at how company recruiters use AI to evaluate potential candidates. We are achieving this by creating a model and website that evaluates a potential candidate's resume, and recommends them based on the analysis of the model. 

*What Next?*

*Responsible AI Considerations:*
As we examine the use of AI in Human Resources—specifically, resume screening tools—we recognize the importance of designing and evaluating these systems with responsibility, transparency, and fairness at the core. Key responsible AI principles we considered include:
-  Fairness and Bias Mitigation: AI-driven resume scanners may inadvertently learn and perpetuate historical biases present in hiring data (e.g., gender, race, or educational background). Our project explores how training data, feature selection, and model design can introduce bias—and how techniques like auditing, de-biasing, and algorithmic fairness checks can help mitigate it.
-  Transparency and Explainability
-  Accountability
-  Privacy and Data Security
-  Accessibility and Inclusion
