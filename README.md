The system will include:

1. A resume scanning tool integrated into a web-based application for companies to use in their hiring process.
2. A deep learning model to classify whether a candidate's resume is qualified for a specific job role or not based on predefined criteria (e.g., skills, experience, education).
3. The integration of AI to streamline the candidate selection process and reduce human bias.

**Project Details**

In this case project, we are trying to better understand/provide insight into how AI plays a roll in human resources management.

We are achieving this by creating a model and website that evaluates a potential candidate's resume, and recommends them based on the analysis of the model.
