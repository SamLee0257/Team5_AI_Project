# Team5_AI_Project

Team 5 final project on the use of AI in Human Resource activities. 

**Authors:** Sam Lee, Thomas Lavelle, Drew Messick, and Marshall Pender.  

**Project Scope:** 

To design and develop an AI-based system that assists human resources (HR) departments in screening resumes efficiently. 

The system will include:

-A resume scanning tool integrated into a web-based application for companies to use in their hiring process.

-A deep learning model to classify whether a candidate's resume is qualified for a specific job role or not based on predefined criteria (e.g., skills, experience, education).

-The integration of AI to streamline the candidate selection process and reduce human bias.
